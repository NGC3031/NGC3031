- 👋 Hi, I’m @NGC3031
- 👀 I’m interested in most things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something
- 📫 How to reach me?

Ok welcome, I haven't pushed much the last couple of years but I am sort of back I think. I am always dabbling with something or other so there will
be some syncing here and there from different systems. So be patient ...

Other things, I have to admit I was suprised to look in on my old MQTT code and see it has been reasonably used. I wrote it over a week a couple of 
years back and never got back to it. From memory there were was a race issue with concurrency or something. Anyway might get back and clean that up
now that everyone is IOT-ing.

Currently working on a node framework and doing a lot more python ML etc. So expect to see more of that. Started playing about with Swift recently 
so who knows...

Tools of the trade...some laptops - including a new HP Victus that I actually like, a Macbook Pro and an i7 desktop from 09. Should I include my 
1983 MicroBee? Oh one of the old laptops I run as an Ark server.

Anyway any cool projects let me know.
